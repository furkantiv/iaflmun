🌍 MUN Event Website

A small volunteer project for my cousin’s high-school MUN conference.

📌 About This Project

This website was created as a simple, fast, and clean site to help my younger cousin promote and organize their high-school Model United Nations (MUN) event.
The goal was to provide them with:

A modern and mobile-friendly landing page

Basic event information: committees, schedule, venue

An easy way for students to access the registration form

A domain + lightweight hosting setup

This project is intentionally minimal and designed for educational / community purposes, not as a commercial product.

🎯 Why This Repository Is Public

I decided to keep this repository public because:

It may help other students running small MUN events

It provides a simple starter template for similar school projects

The codebase is intentionally lightweight and beginner-friendly

Transparency encourages other students to learn from real examples

Also GitHub Pages for free hosting :D

🔔 Note: This project is not representative of my professional code quality or enterprise-level work.
It was built quickly as a supportive gesture and is scoped intentionally small.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Vite (optional, depending on your setup)

GitHub Pages for free hosting

🚀 Deployment

The site is deployed via GitHub Pages, making it easy for students to reuse or clone for their own events.

🤝 Credits
