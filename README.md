# 🌍 MUN Event Website  
*A small volunteer project for my cousin’s high-school MUN conference.*

---

## 📌 About This Project
This website was created as a **simple, modern, and clean landing page** to support my younger cousin’s high-school **Model United Nations (MUN)** event.

The primary goals were:
- Provide a mobile-friendly information page  
- Present event details such as committees, schedule, and venue  
- Offer easy access to registration  
- Deliver a quick and reliable hosting setup with a custom domain  

This project was built for **educational/community and f purposes**, not as a production-grade product.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Is Public
I chose to keep this repository open because:

- It might help students organizing similar MUN events  
- The structure is lightweight and beginner-friendly  
- Transparency can inspire others learning web development
- Also for free hosting from Github Pages :D

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This project is *not* intended to reflect my professional code quality or *enterprise-level* work.  
> It was created quickly as a supportive gesture and intentionally kept small in scope.
